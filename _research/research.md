My research focuses on the development and application of numerical methods to solve complex problems in computer graphics, 
computer vision, and geometric processing. I am particularly interested in the use of nonlinear PDEs,  for simulating physical and geometric phenomena.
This includes the study of algorithms for solving parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, with applications in areas such as 3D surface modeling, 
dynamic systems, and the simulation of material behavior. I also explore stochastic approaches to PDEs, where uncertainty and randomness play a significant role.
